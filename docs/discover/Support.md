# Request a device #

I understand the pain of not having a nice Pixel Port. In order to get your device supported, your device needs to pass the following prerequisites:

- Does NOT have a Pixel port
- Is a Xiaomi series phone (Including Redmi and Poco.)
- Has enough testers 
- Has dynamic (Device launched with Q)

If your device passes all the prerequisites, you can request by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/JamieHoSzeYui/pixel-infra). I will look into it when I have free time (sadly I lack free time).
