# Overview #

It is what it is. Pixel Betas, ported to my phones.


### Features ###

- Pixel's latest beta otapackage (non Generic System Image)

- Inlined vendor, system (and ODM) props

- Save extra juice with Pixel's algorithms

- Pretty much everything you can get with a Pixel

- Carefully picked features (removed some that device doesn't support / we don't need)

- Minimal debloat that you'll thank me for.

- Encryption to keep your data safe 

### Install ###

Installation of the ROM is easy. Just simply download the ZIP, and then boot to recovery and sideload / select otapackage from USB. Starting from S Beta 3, our otapackages are signed by SignAPK so it has the compability of flashing with AOSP Recovery.
