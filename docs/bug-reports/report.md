# Reporting a bug #

After grabbing logs (as mentioned in the last post), you can file an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/JamieHoSzeYui/pixel-infra/issues/new/choose). Just follow the issue template and fill out the issue form properly. We will look into it and provide a fix ASAP.

Do NOT spam the Issue section. I will NOT bother reading any of your issues if someone attempts to spam it.

Double check if your issue has been opened yet. You should also check if you're using everything stock (kernel, magisk modules, etc.). If you're using any debloat / custom kernel / magisk module / tweak that we are shipping with out of the box, we will NOT provide any help.

If you don't have a GitHub ID, please report a bug at our support group or just make a GitHub ID and file an issue.

Your bug reporting means a lot to us!
