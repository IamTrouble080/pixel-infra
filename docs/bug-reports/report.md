# Reporting a bug #

After grabbing logs (as mentioned in the last post), you can file an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/JamieHoSzeYui/pixel-infra/issues). Just follow the issue template and fill out the issue form properly. We will look into it and provide a fix ASAP.

Do NOT spam the Issue section. I will NOT bother reading any of your issues if someone attempts to spam it.

If you don't have a GitHub ID, please report a bug at our support group or just make a GitHub ID and file an issue.

Your bug reporting means a lot to us!
